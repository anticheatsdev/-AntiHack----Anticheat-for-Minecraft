# -----Anticheat-for-Minecraft
 AntiHack is a fork of the very popular anti-hacking plugin, AntiCheat. After its discontinuation, many server administrators wished to have this plugin updated. That's the goal of this project; to maintain, continue, and build upon the original AntiCheat. AntiHack will hook into your existing configuration data for the original AntiCheat, so that you can seamlessly switch between the two.  AntiHack helps server admins easily identify and block malicious users by monitoring and analyzing the behavior of players. AntiHack looks for tell-tale signs of hacked clients and implements limits into the game so that players cannot gain an advantage by hacking.
